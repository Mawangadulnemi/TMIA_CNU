    "    users_sentence=\"죽음이라, 아주 죽음인데 근 1년 동안 내 주위에서 두 명이나 목숨을 잃었어. 내 나이 18살, 많으면 많고 적으면 적은 나이인데 저런 죽음을 1년에 두 번이나 겪게 되니 죽음에 대한 공포감이 갑자기 느껴지지만, 그 둘 다 조용히 편안하게 죽은 게 아닌 교통사고로 죽었어. 한 명은 버지 아들, 또 한 명은 이모의 딸이야. 슬픈 감정은 없지만 죽었다는 소식을 들을 때마다 죽음에 대한 공포가 생각났어. 나도 길을 건너다 교통사고로 죽으면 어떡하나, 먼 친척이 아닌 내 부모님이나 내 누나가 죽는다면 어떡하나 이런 막막하고 답답한 생각이 들면서 공포를 가끔씩 느끼게 돼. 나이를 더 먹고 나서 수많은 죽음을 대하게 된다면 이 정도 느낌은 없어지겠지만, 현재 나로서는 너무 무서워. 역시 간이 작은 걸까. 죽은 사람들에 대한 막막한 공포심과 두려움 때문에 답답하고 무서워. 도와줘. 마왕, 사실 그 죽음을 우리가 현실적으로 가깝게 느끼는 거는 좀 경우들이 제각각 많이 다른 것 같아요. 그때도 우리 좀 노는 오빠의 미신적 상담소, 리틀 플레이드 브라더스 카운셀링 오피스 상담 중에 할아버지가 돌아가셨는데 슬픔이 느껴지지 않아서 죄의식을 느낀다는 상담을 한 적이 있었죠. 사실 뭐 할아버지 친척, 막 이렇게 이야기를 해도 정을 주고받은 그 시간들이나 기억들이 존재하지 않으면 실감이 안 나니까. 저 같은 경우에 그래서 어렸을 때 죽은 병아리로 인해 공포를 느꼈어요. 슬픈 것도 슬픈 거지만 그게 참 공포가 컸었고, 그러다 보니까 비교적 어린 나이에서 지금까지 죽음에 대해 참으로 많이 생각했던 것 같아요. 그 궁금증을 해소하기 위해서 종교에서는, 철학에서는, 다른 어떤 사람들의 어떤 신념이나, 아니면 영화에서는 항상 그런 것들을 찾아보고 약간 오컬트적인 이야기도 보기도 했죠. 예를 들어 무슨 사후세계, 티벳 사자경에서 나오는 윤회에 대한 이야기들, 여러 가지 것들을 봤는데, 역시 죽음에 대해서는 명확한 답은 없었어요. 그런데 어쨌든 우리가 피할 수 없는 것은 사람은 태어나서 결국 한 번 죽는다는 거잖아요. 참 인간이 얼마나 비참하면 벽에 칠할 때까지 살겠다고 발버둥치고 산삼 녹용 이런 거 먹으면서 100년 살겠다고 해도, 의사 선생님이 '당신 같은 건강 처음 봅니다'라고 해도 병원 앞 계단에서 미끄러져 뇌진탕으로 죽을 수 있어요. 인간의 생명은 수백 수천 가지 조건이 충족되어야 간신히 존재하는데, 그 조건 중 하나만 꺼져도 촛불처럼 꺼져 버리는 게 인간의 생명 아닙니까. 그런 걸 생각하면 무섭기도 하고 비참하기도 해요. 아무리 발버둥 쳐봐야 우주에서 스쳐 지나가는 먼지 같은 건데 이거 발버둥치고 살 필요 있나 싶은 생각이 들기도 하죠.죽음에 대한 공포가 무뎌지면 두려운 느낌이 없어지겠지만, 지금은 너무 무서워요. 두려움이 없어지는 날이 오면 그것이 당신의 인생이 무감각해지는 날이고, 당신의 인생이 지쳐서 아무 힘없이 표류하고 있다는 뜻일 수 있습니다. 죽음에 대한 공포는 우리가 극복하고 짊어지고 가야 할 문제이지, 둔해지거나 무감각해져서 외면하거나 피해야 할 문제는 아니라고 생각합니다. 죽음에 대한 공포가 없다면 하잘 것 없는 인간이 될지도 몰라요. 그래서 겸손하고, 사랑하는 사람들과 함께할 수 있으면 좋겠다고 생각합니다. 퀸의 노래 'Who Wants to Live Forever'도 그렇듯이, 영생하는 것이 좋은 것만은 아닙니다. 사랑하는 사람과 함께 같은 속도로 늙어가고 주름진 얼굴을 서로 쓰다듬으며 함께 죽음을 맞이할 수 있다면 좋겠죠. 그런 생각을 하며 살아가면 죽음에 대한 공포를 어느 정도 극복할 수 있을 겁니다.\",\n",
