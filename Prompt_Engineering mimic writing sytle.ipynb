    "# Instructing LLMs To Match Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs that generate text are awesome, but what if you want to edit the tone/style it responds with?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've all seen the [pirate](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_llm_agent.html#:~:text=template%20%3D%20%22%22%22Answer%20the%20following%20questions%20as%20best%20you%20can%2C%20but%20speaking%20as%20a%20pirate%20might%20speak.%20You%20have%20access%20to%20the%20following%20tools%3A) examples, but it would be awesome if we could tune the prompt to match the tone of specific people?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a series of techniques aimed to generate text in the tone and style you want. No single technique will likely be *exactly* what you need, but I guarantee you can iterate with these tips to get a solid outcome for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Greg, what about fine tuning? Fine tuning would likely give you a fabulous result, but the barriers to entry are too high for the average developer (as of May '23). I would rather get the 87% solution today rather than not ship something. If you're doing this in production and your differentiator is your ability to adapt to different styles you'll likely want to explore fine tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see a demo video of this, check out the Twitter post. For a full explination head over to YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 Levels Of Tone Matching Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Simple:** As a human, try and describe the tone you would like\n",
    "2. **Intermediate:** Include your description + examples\n",
    "3. **AI-Assisted:** Ask the LLM to extract tone, use their output in your next prompt\n",
    "4. **Technique Fusion:** Combine multiple techniques to mimic tone\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today's Goal**: Generate tweets mimicking the style of online personalities. You could customize this code to generate emails, chat messages, writing, etc.\n",
